# 🃏 Blackjack Game (Python)

A simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python. This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate core Python skills including loops, functions, control flow, and basic game logic.

## 🃏 Game Rules

- Both the player (you) and the dealer (computer) are dealt 2 cards.

- You can see both of your cards and only one of the dealer’s cards.

- You may choose to:

  - Hit – draw another card.

  - Stand – stop drawing cards.

- If your total exceeds 21, you bust and lose immediately.

- After you stand, the dealer reveals their hidden card.

- The dealer must draw cards until their total is 17 or higher.

- If the dealer’s total exceeds 21, they bust and you win.

- If neither player busts, the hand with the higher total wins.

- If both totals are the same, it results in a draw (also called a "push").

- Card values:

  - 2–10: Face value

  - J, Q, K: 10 points each

  - Ace (A): 1 or 11 points — whichever is more favorable without busting
